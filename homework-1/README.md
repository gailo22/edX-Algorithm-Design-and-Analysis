# Submitting this assignment

#### Before You Submit
Please be sure that:
* your Sorting class and MinHeap class are in the default package, i.e. there is no “package” declaration at the top of the source code
* your classes compile and you have not changed the signature of any methods we've asked you to fill in.
* you have not created any additional .java files


#### Step 1. Upload your code to the 'submit' folder

Upload your *Sorting.java* and *MinHeap.java* source code to the 'submit' folder.

You may do this by clicking on the 'submit' folder icon in the Filetree on the left and then using the File -> Upload... option on the menu bar above.

Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the file from your computer into the 'submit' folder in the Filetree on the left.

If you do not see the Filetree on the left side of this window, select View -> File Tree from the menu bar above.

Your *Sorting.java* and *MinHeap.java* files **must** be in the 'submit' folder in order for you to submit this assignment. Make sure it's not in the root directory or any other folder.


#### Step 2. Run the autograder before you submit 
Please note that you will only be able to submit your code **once** in Step 3 and cannot resubmit it, so we recommend you run the grader in this step before your final submission.

You may do so by clicking the 'Run Autograder' button on the menu bar above (it should be to the right of 'Help').

This will automatically copy your source code from the 'submit' folder to the 'test' folder, compile it, and run all of our tests (you only have to copy the files that we've told you to edit.  We run our tests with any other necessary files internally).

When you run the tests, you will see a console window appear with the results of the tests and your score (if less than 100%).

If your code does not compile or is not in the 'submit' folder, you will see an error message. 

If you'd like to modify your code before attempting to re-run the grader or before submitting, you can click on the name of the file in the 'submit' folder of the Filetree on the left and modify the code in the editor that appears. Be sure that you're editing the version of your code that is in the 'submit' folder, and don't forget to save it! 



#### Step 3. Submit the code
Please note that you will only be able to submit your code **once** and cannot resubmit it.

When you're ready to submit your code for grading, select Education -> Mark as Completed from the menu bar above.

This will automatically copy your *Sorting.java* and *MinHeap.java* code from the 'submit' folder to our folder for grading, compile it, and then re-run all of the tests.
